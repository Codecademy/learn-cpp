//“using namespace std” means we use the namespace named std. “std” is an abbreviation for standard. 
//If we don’t want to use this line of code, we can use the things in this namespace like this. std::cout, std::endl.
//If this namespace is not used, then computer finds for the cout, cin and endl etc.. Computer cannot identify those and therefore it throws errors.
